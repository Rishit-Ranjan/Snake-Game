- **Polished UI:** A clean interface with a title screen, in-game score display, and a game-over screen with restart options.

## üçé Dynamic Food System

The game features several types of food, each with a unique effect:

| Food Type     | Color   | Effect                                      |
|---------------|---------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Normal**    | Red     | Increases the snake's length by 1.          |
| **Bonus**     | Yellow  | Triples the snake's growth (adds 3 segments). |
| **Speed Boost** | Cyan    | Grants a temporary burst of super speed.    |
| **Shrink**    | Magenta | **Warning:** Makes your snake shorter!        |
| **Ghost**     | White   | Grants temporary immunity to wall collisions (in non-wrap mode). |

## üéÆ How to Play

### Objective
Control the snake to eat as much food as possible and grow its length. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the walls (unless "Wrap Around" mode is enabled). Your score is the final length of your snake.

### Controls

| Key         | Action                  |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| `Arrow Keys`| Change the snake's direction. |
| `P`         | Pause or resume the game.     |
